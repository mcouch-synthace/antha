Todo for parked branch ANTHA-1810/regenInstructions

There are two known issues:

1 the tree generation step doesn't consistently apply changes to LHProperties

This needs to happen correctly both in the case of high level liquid handler and low level
- I had thought that the bottom of the tree would be the most sensible place to do this
as the most information is available, but this may not be smartest

2 Instructions which solely change IDs on generate may have no effect

I.e. splitSample and Prompt. Need to add test cases for liquidhandler.Generate
for these specifically to check whether more work is needed here
